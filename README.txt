My project is about fixing the original website ARGENS.NET.  The original was cluttered with product pictures and unaligned text.
I turned the website into easy to use and appealing to the eye.  I uncluttered the website into sections allowing for a better user experience.
I also got rid of the color coating system and seperated when they are availabe.
